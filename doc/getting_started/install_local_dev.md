# Contributor Local Installation

Set up a PyRIT development environment on your local machine.

```{note}
**Development Version:** Contributor installations use the **latest development code** from the `main` branch, not a stable release. The notebooks in your cloned repository will match your code version.
```

## Setup with uv

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a fast Python package installer and resolver that we use for PyRIT development.

**Why uv?**
- **Much faster** than pip (10-100x faster dependency resolution)
- **Simpler** environment management for pure Python projects
- **Native Windows support** — no WSL required, although if using a devcontainer, WSL is recommended
- **Automatic virtual environment management**
- **Compatible with existing pyproject.toml**

### Prerequisites

1. **Install uv**: Download from [https://github.com/astral-sh/uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) or use:
   for windows:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```
   for macOS and Linux
   ```
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```
   or
   ```
   wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Python 3.11-3.14**: PyRIT supports these versions, and CI tests all of them. The repository does
   not pin an interpreter, so `uv` selects a compatible one for you (downloading it if needed).

3. **Git**. Git is required to clone the repo locally. It is available to download [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/PyRIT
    ```

4. **Node.js and npm**. Required for building the TypeScript/React frontend. Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm). Version 22 or higher is required (the frontend's `react-router` dependency requires Node >= 22.22.0).

### Installation

1. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the PyRIT repo.

2. From the root of your clone, run:

```bash
uv sync
```

This command will:
- Create a `.venv` directory with a virtual environment
- Download a supported Python version if none is already available
- Install PyRIT in editable mode; `uv sync` by default installs in editable mode so no extra flag is necessary
- Install all dependencies including dev tools (pytest, ruff, etc.) via the `dev` dependency group
- Create a `uv.lock` file for reproducible builds

To pin your checkout to a single version, run `uv python pin 3.12`. That writes a
`.python-version` file, which is local to your working copy and not tracked by the repository.


3. Verify Installation

```bash
uv pip show pyrit
```

You should see output showing the most recent PyRIT version and your Python dependencies.

### VS Code Integration

VS Code should automatically detect the `.venv` virtual environment. If not:

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type "Python: Select Interpreter"
3. Choose `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`

#### Running Jupyter Notebooks

`uv sync` already installs a `python3` kernel inside `.venv`, and Jupyter binds it to whichever
interpreter is running it, so notebooks work out of the box with no kernel registration step.

Start the server using
```bash
uv run jupyter lab
```
or using VS Code, open a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) window, in the top search bar of VS Code, type `>Notebook: Select Notebook Kernel` > `Python Environments...` to choose the `.venv` interpreter for this checkout. You can also choose a kernel with the "Select Kernel" button on the top-right corner of a Notebook.

This will be the kernel that runs all code examples in Python Notebooks.

If you do want a separately named kernel, scope it to the virtual environment:

```bash
uv run python -m ipykernel install --sys-prefix --name=pyrit-dev
```

Avoid `--user` with a fixed name if you work in more than one clone or git worktree. A `--user`
kernel is installed machine-wide, so every checkout that registers the same name overwrites the
others, and the survivor points at a single interpreter. Notebooks then execute against an
unrelated checkout, or fail with `FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2]` once that checkout is deleted.
See [Jupyter setup](troubleshooting/jupyter_setup.md) if you hit this.


#### Running Python Scripts

Use `uv run` to execute Python with the virtual environment:

```bash
uv run python your_script.py
```

#### Running Tests

```bash
uv run pytest tests/
```

#### Running Specific Test Files

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_something.py
```

#### Using PyRIT CLI Tools

```bash
uv run pyrit_scan --help
uv run pyrit_shell
```

#### Running Jupyter Notebooks

```bash
uv run jupyter lab
```

#### Installing Additional Extras

PyRIT has several optional dependency groups. Install them as needed:

```bash
# For Hugging Face models
uv sync --extra huggingface

# For all extras
uv sync --extra all

# Multiple extras (dev dependencies are always included automatically)
uv sync --extra playwright --extra gcg
```

### Development Workflow

#### Keep the backend, CLI, and frontend in lockstep

The backend, CLI, and browser bundle must have exactly the same
`<Python package version>+g<full source commit>` compatibility identity. Editable
installation stamps the checkout; Vite stamps its bundle from the same source.
After changing commits, refresh the stamp and restart the backend and Vite:

```bash
python -m build_scripts.stamp_compatibility --development
```

For locally packaged frontend assets, run
`python -m build_scripts.prepare_package --development`. Dirty local changes warn
but do not change the identity. These assets cannot be published. Wheel and sdist
build hooks reject dirty sources and build matching assets automatically; installed
clients read their packaged stamp, never local Git or the connected backend.

A compatibility failure requires matching artifacts, not bypassing the header.
Reload the browser only after matching artifacts are deployed; mounted UI state is
retained when a later mismatch blocks work. Do not automatically replay mutations.
See [the protocol and API example](../../pyrit/backend/README.md#strict-lockstep-compatibility).

#### Adding New Dependencies

Edit `pyproject.toml` to add dependencies, then run:

```bash
uv sync
```

#### Updating Dependencies

```bash
uv lock --upgrade
uv sync
```

#### Running Code Formatters

```bash
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check --fix .
```

#### Running Type Checker

```bash
uv run ty check pyrit/
```

#### Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Next Step: Configure PyRIT

After installing, configure your AI endpoint credentials.
