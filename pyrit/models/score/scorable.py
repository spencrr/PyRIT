    What a scorer looks at.

    A scorable is normally an inert reference: it names the evidence instead of carrying
    or acquiring it. ``ContentScorable`` is the exception, because loose content has
    nothing behind it to point at. A scorer-family resolver acquires the named evidence.

    A scorable that can be stored on a ``Score`` joins ``ScorableUnion`` and declares a
    ``scorable_type`` tag, which is what storage round-trips it on.
