Target instance catalog models.

Targets have two concepts:

- Types: Static metadata bundled with the frontend (from the registry).
- Instances: Runtime objects created via the API with specific configuration.

The ``TargetInstance`` model is the wire-format snapshot for a runtime
target, used by both the backend (as a REST response payload) and external
REST clients (the CLI today, future external clients tomorrow). Because it
*is* the REST response model (FastAPI serves it directly), per-field
``Field(..., description=...)`` strings live here so they surface in the
generated OpenAPI schema.

Identity lives on the embedded ``TargetIdentifier`` (class
name, endpoint, model name, generation params, inner-target identifiers) and is
*not* duplicated as flat fields on ``TargetInstance``. Capabilities live on the
embedded ``TargetCapabilities``.

    Identity (class name, endpoint, model name, generation params, and inner
